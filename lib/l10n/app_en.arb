      "legal_info_content": "<body><p><h3>How to improve my picture evidence</h3> Here are some tips for providing better picture evidence: <body> <li> Allow Sisterhood to track your location and geotag your pictures. This allows the police to see where the picture was taken, which strengthens your case.<br/></li> <li> If you feel comfortable, ask a family member or friend you trust to take a picture of you and your injuries as well as a selfie of both of you. That way your family member or friend can corroborate your story and be your witness.<br/></li> <li> Take pictures of yourself and your injuries in your home or places you are known to frequently visit. That way the police can connect your injuries with known objects in your house. For instance, in front of your couch, in the kitchen where you can see the dining table/chairs in the background etc. The picture below shows an example: <br/> <img src={asset} alt='legal_info'></li> <li> Take multiple pictures over time. Injuries change over time, so make sure that you take pictures that reflect these changes. For instance, a bruise usually starts off being red. After 1-2 days the bruise will appear blue, purple or even black. After 5-10 days, your bruise turns yellow or green and after 10-14 days your bruise will likely have a yellowish brown or light brown color. Take pictures of these changes and use the “edit function” in the “View History” page to upload additional pictures.<br/></li> </body> <p> </p> <br> <h3>I have abruptly left my home but want to get my things from our apartment</h3> If you had to urgently leave your home or if your abuser abruptly left and you would like to receive or remove property, such as personal belongings, clothes, electronics, furniture etc. you can apply for “Handräckning” via Kronofogden. You can read more about it here Please note that handräckning has some consequences, for example if the defendant objects to handräckningen, you can request Kronofodgen to hand over the case to a judge who will make the decision. In certain special events, Kronofodgen will make the decision. When a decision is reached for both normal and special cases, Kronofogden will contact both parties to see how the situation can be resolved in the most appropriate way. If it is not possible to solve on a voluntary basis, Kronofogden can go into a home with a locksmith to get things out. <br><br> <h3>My partner has forced me to take on debt.</h3> If your partner has forced you (through threats or otherwise) to take on a debt, you have to report it to the police as soon as possible. For these cases time is of the essence. If you are getting collection letters from Kronofodgen, respond with an objection and explain the circumstances. In some cases, Kronofodgen will invalidate the debt. Read more about it <a href={url1}>here</a> <br> <br><br> <h3>I want to apply for sole custody of our child/children</h3> If you and your partner cannot come to an agreement you can file a lawsuit with claims about how you want the court to decide on custody, housing and contact. The court will then request an investigation from the Family Court. As part of the investigation, conversations are held with both parents and the child / children if it is appropriate with regard to the child's age and maturity. The family court then gives a proposal for a decision regarding custody, housing, and contact that should be in line with the child's best interests. This investigation, together with the evidence presented and the conversations held in court, is the basis for the court's judgment. <br><br> <h3>I don’t want to leave my partner, is there any support for those who abuse? </h3> Yes, there are organizations that support men who abuse. For instance, <a href={url2}> Manscentrum </a> <br>offers counseling, which can help clarify, process and find solutions to men’s emotional and practical problems. If your partner has been convicted for domestic abuse, then the Swedish Prison and Probation Service offer treatment programs that are reviewed and quality assured.</p></body>",

      "domestic_abuse": "What is domestic abuse",
      "domestic_content": "<body><p><p>Domestic abuse within a relationship tends to grow over time. In the beginning, violence is rare. At first the abusive partner may make demands or assert dominance, which seem innocent and harmless. But over time, the parties in the relationship change as the abusers' control and violence increase. This often forces the woman to adapt and agree to the increasing demands to avoid further conflicts. Resisting often leads to increased violence.</p><br><br>In general, abuse often begins with psychological violence, such as critical and derogatory comments, which causes the woman to stop believing in herself. Then the physical violence can come as a continuation.<br><br>It is common for the woman to become isolated and lose her social contacts and stop doing things on her own. The abuser often forbids the woman to interact with her friends and family. This increases the woman’s dependency on her abusive partner.<br><br>More information can be found at <a href={domestic_abuse_url1}>Nationellt Centrum för Kvinnofrid.</a><br><br>It is important to know and recognize that abuse comes in different forms and the woman often experience a mix between different types of abuse, such as:<br><br><h3>Physical abuse</h3> Often called assault. It is when the perpetrator does something to the woman's body that hurts, harms and/or causes discomfort. It can be anything from pushes, kicks and blows to strangulation, restraint or attacking the woman with some kind of object.<br><br><h3>Psychological abuse</h3> Is when the perpetrator through words and aggressive behavior limits the woman's life. Through psychological abuse the perpetrator can isolate the woman by not letting her interact with other people. Apart from isolation, psychological abuse can include threats, blackmail and control that gradually leads to psychological breakdown. Psychological violence can also mean that threats are made against children, pets or other relatives of the victim. The man can also ridicule or shame his partner, for example the woman's behavior, opinions and / or her way of being.<br><br><h3>Sexual abuse</h3> Involves forcing someone to engage in, perform or witness sexual acts against their will. It can be about sexual harassment, being forced to watch porn, involuntary touching or rape. It is not uncommon that the victim feeling that she needs to be sexually accessible in order to avoid other forms of violence.<br><br><h3>Economic abuse</h3> Is when the woman has no control over her own financial resources. It may be that she is not allowed to keep her salary or is prevented from working. The perpetrator can also take out loans in the woman’s name, sometimes against her will, and have access to her bank ID. Ultimately, this reduces the woman’s independence. Aside from that, economic violence can affect a woman's creditworthiness, which can make it challenging for her to obtain a home or take out loans of her own. Often, the perpetrator takes control of the finances and other material assets in order to increase isolation, vulnerability and make it more difficult for the woman to leave the relationship.<br><br><h3>Emotional abuse</h3> Sometimes this can intertwine with psychological abuse but generally, emotional abuse is a way to control the woman using emotions to criticize, embarrass, shame, blame, or otherwise manipulate the woman with the goal of breaking down her self-esteem and undermining her mental health. Gaslighting is a common form of emotional abuse where the woman starts doubting her own feelings and questioning her reality.<br><br><h3>Digital abuse</h3> Digital abuse is the use of technologies, such as texting and social networking, to bully, harass, stalk or intimidate a partner. It can also include reading messages or emails and/or figuring out passwords alternatively demanding that the woman provides her passwords as a proof of love / honesty. In some instances, the perpetrator stalks the woman on social media or other apps. Another form of digital abuse is overcommunication, meaning that the perpetrator sends too many text messages and emails to control the woman.<br><br><h3>Passive physical violence</h3> Is exposing someone to violence that has direct physical consequences. For instance, it can be about denying someone sleep or exposing someone to long-term mental stress that causes physical side effects. In some cases, passive physical violence can be linked to someone else’s vulnerable situation, such as withholding medicine or aids from a person who has a disability or illness.<br><br>You can read more about domestic abuse on <a href={domestic_abuse_url2}>Unizon’s website.</a><br><br><u>Here are two TED Talk videos from domestic abuse survivors</u><br><br>Emma Murphy’s <a href={domestic_abuse_url3}>I Broke My Silence TED Talk from March 19, 2018</a><br><br>Jasvinder Sanghera’s <a href={domestic_abuse_url4}>Fighting forced marriages and honor-based abuse TED Talk from November 28, 2013</a><br><br></p></body>",

    "helpful_tips_desc": "<body><p><ul> <li> Make a habit of backing the car into the driveway (so you can quickly pull out) and having a full tank of gas. Keep your car keys in the same place so you can easily grab them. If you would be leaving by yourself (if you don’t have children), you might want to even keep the driver’s door unlocked (and the other car doors locked) so that you are prepared to make a quick escape if you have to. If possible, you can leave copies of your identification and other important documents in your car.<br/></li> <li> Think of several reasons for leaving the house at different times of the day or night that the abuser will believe, in case you feel that the violence is about to erupt, and you need an excuse to get out.<br/></li> <li> If you can have a bag packed with the items you want to bring, such as legal documents, a set of clothes, medication etc. You can hide your back somewhere the abuser will not find it. Perhaps leaving it with a trusted friend or family member. Try not to use close family members or mutual friends as the abuser may find it there.<br/></li> <li> If possible, let friends and neighbors who you trust know what is going on in your home. Make a plan with them so that they know when you need help and so they know what to do (such as calling the police or banging on your door). Make up a signal with a trusted neighbor, like flashing the lights on and off or hanging something out the window, which will alert him/her that you need help.<br/></li> <li> If you need help in a public place, yell “Fire!” People respond more quickly to someone yelling “fire” than to any other cry for help.<br/></li> <li> Keep the number to Kvinnofridslinjen on your phone under a hidden name, if you need to call them.<br/></li> <li> If you have children, tell them not to get involved if the abuser is hurting you since they may get hurt too. Decide on a code word to let them know that they should leave the house and get help. If the abuser won’t let them leave the house safely, figure out with them where would be a safe place for them to go within the house where they can call for help (such as a room with a lock and a phone). Make sure they know that their priority is to stay safe, not to physically protect you.<br/></li> <li> Practice different ways to get out of your house safely. If you have children, practice with them as well.<br/></li> <li> In your household, be aware of anything the abuser can use as a weapon. If you can, try and keep any sharp or heavy objects that he may use to hurt you, like a hammer or an ice pick, out of the way.<br/></li> <li> Figure out where the “safer places” are in your home – the places where there aren’t weapons within arm’s reach. If it looks like the abuser is about to hurt you, try to get to a safer place. Stay out of the kitchen, garage, workshop or other room where items that can be used as weapons are kept. Try to avoid rooms with tile or hardwood floors if possible.<br/></li> <li> If there’s no way to escape the violence at that moment, make yourself a small target. Dive into a corner and curl up into a ball. Protect your face and put your arms around each side of your head, wrapping your fingers together.<br/></li> <li> Try not to wear scarves or long jewelry. The abuser could use these things to strangle you.<br/></li> </ul> </p></body>",

By understanding how you interact with our products we can improve our features within the app and on our website. <br/></li><li>If you allow us to use your information when creating content, we have the ability to reduce defamation by using your location to link the experiences you provide to us. Tracking your location also strengthens your case as the police needs to ensure that you are who you say you are, and that there is a clear connection between the information you provide, such as text, videos, images, sound files and documents, and places that you frequently visit (your home, friends and family’s home, place of work, or areas surrounding your home). <br/></li><li>Sisterhood does not sell your information for ad purposes or partner with for profit companies to sell services, but we do sell and use your information for research purposes in order to better improve policies and legislation surrounding domestic abuse. By anonymizing your data, we can provide governments, municipalities, social services, police, and women’s shelters (among others) with better and more accurate statistics about domestic abuse. For example, Sisterhood can regionally provide municipalities with what type of abuse is most prevalent by using the information from our users in their area. <br/></li><li>To promote safety and security. We use your information to verify accounts and activity to prevent spam and harmful conduct. For example, we use the information you provide to investigate abuse in our app and violations of our terms and conditions. <br/></li><li>Research and innovate for the public good. Sisterhood’s goal is to empower domestically abused women and give them a voice in court by improving evidence. At our core, we conduct and support research to combat domestic violence and improve gender equality. For example, we analyze the information our users collectively provide to uncover patterns in domestic abuse and inform governments and legislators of the need for improved policies, funding, and overall resource allocation. <br/></li></ul><h3>How will we store your data?</h3>Our company securely stores your data using Google Cloud storage solutions and Firebase. Google Cloud's infrastructure has built-in protections to ensure that your information, identity, apps, and devices are protected. Additionally, Google Cloud encrypts the data in transit between their facilities, which ensures that it can only be accessed by authorized roles. <br><br>Since the data Sisterhood is collecting serves to improve and strengthen evidence, the data will be stored for the duration of the prescription period, which varies depending on the crime. Thus, personal data is retained for as long as it is needed for the purposes of collecting evidence and building a criminal case.<br>Based on the prescription period from 35 kap. 1 § Brottsbalken (BrB) the data will be stored as follows:<ul style='st-style-type:circle'><li>For murder where the maximum sentence is life in prison, the data will be stored for 25 years<br/></li><li>For violent abuse where the maximum sentence is over 8 years, the data will be stored for 15 years<br/></li><li>For violent abuse where the maximum sentence is 6 years, the data will be stored for 10 years<br/></li><li>For abuse where the maximum sentence is 2 years, the data will be stored for 5 years<br/></li><li>For abuse where the maximum sentence is 1 year, the data will be stored for 2 years. <br/></li></ul><h3>What are your data protection rights?</h3>Sisterhood would like to make sure that you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights.
